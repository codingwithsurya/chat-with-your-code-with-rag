# Chat with Your Code with RAG! Powered by Llama3.1 ðŸ¦™ðŸš€

This repo enables you to have an AI-powered conversational interface with your GitHub codebase. By integrating the leading frontier open-source model, Llama3-450b, fine-tuned with retrieval augmented generation, you can now search and understand any codebase in natural language.

You can access it here, on Lightning AI: https://lightning.ai/ssubrama32/studios/chat-with-your-code-with-rag-powered-by-llama3-1. You can run it by clicking `Open in Free Studio`, navigating to `Streamlit Apps` on the right hand side, choosing `app.py` and then click `Run`! The cool thing about Lighting AI is that you can easily rent GPUs on the cloud, for free! Make sure to install ollama and run `ollama run llama3.1:450b` to start the model :)

## About RAG

The RAG (retrieval augmented generation) model combines the best of retrieval and generative response capabilities to provide contextually appropriate responses based on a retrieved set of documents (or code in this case!). More details on the RAG approach can be found in the [original RAG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401). In this project, RAG is fine-tuned with Llama3 to specifically adapt to the domain of code, enhancing its ability to understand and generate code reviews and snippets accurately, and most importantly, in context with the whole repo.

## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a hierarchical representation of the structure of source code. It is used to understand and analyze the syntax and semantics of code files. In this project, the AST is utilized to parse the GitHub repository, allowing the model to comprehend the code structure and relationships between different parts of the codebase. By analyzing the AST, the model can provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses during interactions.

## Repository Structure
- **`main.ipynb`**: Sample Jupyter notebook to show you how it works!
- **`chat_with_code.py`**: This module interacts with a GitHub repository, cloning it, loading its data, and setting up a query engine for conversational interactions.
- **`rag_101/`**: Contains the implementation of the RAG model utilized in this project.
- **`architecture-diagram.png`**: A bird's eye view on the project!

## Dependencies

This project utilizes several key libraries:

- **`llama_index`**: For indexing and querying the codebase efficiently via a vector database.
- **`langchain`**: Utilized for embedding the codebase to improve retrieval performance.
- **`ollama`**: Helps us incorporate llama3.1

## Production Environment Setup

I am currently working on setting up a production environment so this project is accessible to everyone. Please bear with me as I try to find more GPUs! ðŸ«¡
